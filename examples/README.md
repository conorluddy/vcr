# Examples

Tier 3 of the catalogue tree: runnable fixtures, loaded one at a time. Each directory has:

- `example.json` — manifest validated by `catalog/schemas/example.schema.json`: id, the tool ids it demonstrates, status, and the run command. Tool records link back through `examples`; `pnpm validate` checks the link both ways.
- `run.sh` — reproduces the fixture and diffs against `expected/`; `run.sh --record` re-records after a deliberate change or tool upgrade.
- `expected/` — hashes and probe metadata, not media.
- `output/` — generated, ignored.

| Example | Demonstrates | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native-svg` | svg, resvg, ffmpeg-ffprobe | PNG hash and ffprobe metadata |
| `ffmpeg-assembly` | imagemagick, ffmpeg-ffprobe | 48 frames at 24 fps mux to exactly 2.000000 s |
| `blender-smoke` | blender | one 320x240 RGBA frame from the app bundle |
| `browser-capture` | gsap, playwright | shuffled-order capture matches sequential; spike report |
| `p5-capture` | p5-js, playwright | seeded sketch, deterministic in any order |
| `three-capture` | three-js, playwright | WebGL scene with alpha, deterministic in any order |

All six were validated on the primary Mac on 2026-10-26. Browser examples use `packages/capture`; their scenes expose `window.__scene = { duration, seek }` and schedule canvas renders on an animation frame.
